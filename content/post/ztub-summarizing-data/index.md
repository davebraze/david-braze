This is a stub for a blog post on the nature of data summaries, whether visual (graphs), numerical (means, standard deviations), or tabular.

# What is a Data Summary? #



# Kinds of Summaries #

* visual summaries, i.e. graphs of various sorts. These might show "raw" data, or a descriptive statistic, or both
* numerical summaries, e.g., means, standard deviations, standard errors, or other *descriptive statistics*
* tabular composites

I won't talk much about tabular summaries because they are really just composites made up of collections of numerical values.

visual summaries can depict various kinds of numerical values. For example, we might show a collection of actual test scores broken down by classroom, or by grade level; we could show a graph of average values (typically in a bar graph), et cetera.

# Problems and Solutions

* overplotting: jitter, transparency
* busy-ness: group (e.g., histogram), summarize (e.g., boxplot)

# Common Mistakes in Summarizing Data

* using the wrong statistic (e.g., mean when median more appropriate)
* too little information (e.g., bar plots without error bars; poor axis labels)
