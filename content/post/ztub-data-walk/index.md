# What is a Data Walk?

Your organization has data. It might be data that you've collected in-house. It might be data from some public resource that bears on your mission. A data walk is a way to refine your understanding of the data you have in hand in order to better serve your need for for answers to questions, progress monitoring, ways to showcase accomplishments. It can also highlight limitations of the data you've got, and so be useful in refining future data collection efforts. What data are missing but necessary?

# What Do I Need to Get Started?

## Data

Of course! It might be data that you have collected in-house, data from some public resource, or a combination of the two. It's also important to be clear about the origins of your data: What is it? Where does it come from?  Who collected it? How was it collected? This is a step toward having good meta-data, which is to say data *about* your data. For each data table that you have, you will want to have a *codebook*. 

A codebook describes the contents, structure, and layout of a data set. A proper codebook will contain complete and self-explanatory description of each variable in a data set. A codebook begins with a basic summary of the data set and an introduction describing the purpose and format of the codebook. A data walk is a good place to identify missing details in your data documentation, and to begin filling in those holes.

## Questions

What do you hope to learn? In the near term? In the long run? 

Your questions should be fairly focussed at this stage of the game. One of the reasons to go on a data walk is to help you to refine your questions and to understand what additional data you might need to really home in on what you want to know.

## Buy-in

Who should be involved in a data walk? Stakeholders of all sorts: Policy makers within your organization; People directly involved in data collection; People (clients or customers) from whom data is collected; others. Sometimes, service organizations will hire former clients as service providers, and these folks can be especially valuable as they bring a dual-perspective to the table.

The data specialist's role is to facilitate conversations about the data among your own people: how and what was collected, and how that might change for the better.
