This is a stub for a series of blog posts where I recommend books on topics that
people ask me about. Here's a start on the list:
* Randomistas: How Radical Researchers Are Changing Our World, by
  Andrew Leigh
  
* Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are, by Kevin
  Mitchell
  
* Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes
  Hope, and Wastes Billions, by Richard Harris

* Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us, by Daniel
  Koretz (2008)
  
  A treatise on the design, purpose, and limitations of standardized
  testing in education. Written for students in the Master of
  Education program at Harvard. The book is relatively accessible and
  will provide valuable insight into the purpose and limitations of
  standardized tests for parents, teachers, and other education
  professionals and policy makers. Koretz is a professor of education
  at Harvard University.
