Evidence-based learning is the buzz word of the last few
years. Andrew Leigh's ***Randomistas*** digs in to one of the most
important forms of evidence, the "randomized controlled trial", and
spells out in plain language just what it is, how it works, and why
it is considered the gold standard for evidence of how things work
in education and many other areas of research.

The book is written with a general audience in mind and readers
won't need any special background to come away with a new
appreciation for randomized trials and the evidence they provide for
what is and isn't effective in educational policy and classroom
practice. That said, the book does not focus on educational research
in particular. It is about randomized trials in general, and that is
one of its strengths. 

The book gives specific examples how randomized controlled trials
show the difference between what works and what doesn't in medicine,
social policy, education, and many other areas. The results have
sometimes been surprising, and an important point that Leigh makes
is that our intuitions (and the intuitions of experts!) about what
should work are often wrong. Randomized trials let us clearly see
whether benefits of a program are real, or just wishful thinking.

I recommend this book for parents, teachers, other educators, and
anyone interested in learning more about the buzz around
evidence-based education, and the importance of evidence aggregators
like the U.S. Department of Education's
[What Works Clearinghouse](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/) and the
independent
[Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/)
in the UK.
