In August of 2020, I gave an eagle's eye introduction to language and its connections to reading skill for the volunteer tutors at [New Haven Reads](https://newhavenreads.org/). NHR has put video of the talk up on their YouTube channel (embedded below), making it my YouTube debut. You can view the slides online [here](/files/foundations-lang-lit-NHR.html). Or, you can download them [here](/files/foundations-lang-lit-NHR.zip). The download is a zip file which you will need to unzip. You can then view the slides in your web browser. 

The talk is divided into these sections:

* Language and its Parts
  + Words
  + Phonemes
  + Morphemes
* Reading
  + Its Relationship to Language
  + Alphabetic Principle
  + Phoneme Awareness
  + Phonics
