In August of 2020, I gave an eagle's eye introduction to language and its connections to reading for the volunteer reading tutors at [New Haven Reads](https://newhavenreads.org/). NHR has put [video of the talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5plHAyDfijU&t=2283s) up on their YouTube channel, making it my YouTube debut. You can also view the slides online here, or download them here. The download is a zip file that you'll need to unzip and can then view in your web browser.
