This is a stub for a blog post where I discuss the concept of data and data collection for people who have little experience with it.

# On spreadsheets

+ convenience for data entry

+ excel and dates

+ spreadsheets vs databases

# On data quality/verification

+ double entry



# Naming variables (columns)

+ Name binary/boolean variables as predicates: is_sped, has_iep, 


+ include units in names of numeric variables: age_months, age_years, 

+ dates and times

# What goes in a column: variable values

+ be consistent!

+ binaries: 0/1 or Y/N or T/F

+ numerics: integers vs fraction, what precision

+ "missing" values

# Wide vs long formats
