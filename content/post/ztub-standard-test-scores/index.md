This is a stub for a blog post on the nature of standardized test scores.

* Types of standardized scores
  * standard scores
  * stanines
  * age-equivalent & grade-equivalent scores (and their problems)

* Normative samples.
  * Is the normative sample a reasonable one in general?
  * Is the normative sample "close enough" to whomever *you* are testing?
  * What happens when the normative sample goes stale?
  
* What are the various types of standardized scores used for? 
  * In assessing individuals: e.g. PPVT
  * In aggregate: state tests
