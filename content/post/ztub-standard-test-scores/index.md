This is a stub for a blog post on the nature of standardized test scores.

* What are standard scores?
  * How are they derived?
  * Normative samples.
  
* What are they used for? 
  * In assessing individuals: e.g. PPVT
  * In aggregate: state tests
  
* What happens when the normative sample goes stale?
