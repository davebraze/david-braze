"Evidence--based practice" has been a buzz word in education for some
years now.[^1] However, understanding just what constitutes evidence,
and what doesn't, can be challenging. In ***Randomistas***, Andrew
Leigh digs in to one of the most important forms of evidence in the
educational, social, and medical sciences, the "randomized controlled
trial". He spells out in plain language just what it is, and why it is
considered the gold standard for evidence of what works in education
and many other areas of research.

The book is written with a general audience in mind, and readers
won't need any special background to come away with a new
appreciation for randomized trials and the evidence they provide for
what is or isn't effective in educational policy and classroom
practice. That said, the book does not focus on educational research
in particular. It is about randomized trials in general, and that is
one of its strengths. 

Leigh gives specific examples how randomized controlled trials reveal
the difference between what works and what doesn't in medicine, social
policy, education, and many other areas. The results have sometimes
been surprising, and an important point that Leigh makes is that
intuitions (even the intuitions of experts!) about what *might* work
are often wrong. Randomized trials let us clearly see whether benefits
of a program are real, or just wishful thinking.

I recommend this book for anyone interested in learning more about
what evidence looks like in relation to evidence-based education, and
the importance of evidence aggregators like the U.S. Department of
Education's [What Works Clearinghouse](https://ies.ed.gov/ncee/wwc/)
and the independent
[Education Endowment Foundation](https://educationendowmentfoundation.org.uk/)
in the UK.
