This is a stub for a blog post where I explore the evolution of the
word "dyslexia" and the concepts that have been associated with it.

# Take 1

Why I don't usually use the word, but when I do, I would typically say
"phonological dyslexia".

Introduce the IDA's definition as being the most consistent with
modern understanding of (at least one common kind) RD.

Maybe there is something interesting to be gleaned from the *ILA*'s (a
Reading Recovery based organization)
[*Research Advisor on Dyslexia*](https://readingrecovery.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/ila-dyslexia-research-advisory_2016.pdf),
along with the
[IDA response](https://dyslexiaida.org/ida-urges-ila-to-review-and-clarify-key-points-in-dyslexia-research-advisory/),
and the
[ILA counterpoint](https://dyslexiaida.org/ida-urges-ila-to-review-and-clarify-key-points-in-dyslexia-research-advisory/).
It might be of interest to look at Rachael Gabriel's article on the RR
website
[*Understanding Dyslexia Laws and Policies*](https://readingrecovery.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jrr_17-2_gabriel-2.pdf);
also see [article by Mary Anne Doyle](https://readingrecovery.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jrr_17-2_doyle-2.pdf).

# Take 2

The original impetus for this stub is an email from Diane Reott (May
13, 2019). That email and my response are pasted below.

Hi Diane,

In my experience, these kinds of conversations have more than their
share of opportunity for misunderstandings. This is mostly rooted in the
fact that the word "dyslexia" means too many different things to
different people, especially when those people are not researchers or
reading specialists. That comes from the fact that the word pre-dates
our modern understanding of reading disabilities.

The distinctions that do make some sense to me are these. First, most of
the time, we are talking about phonologically based reading disability,
consistent with the IDA definition. This is what I might call "dyslexia"
in casual conversation. It is the only thing that I would refer to as
dyslexia (and I'd usually say "phonological dyslexia"), but I do tend to
avoid the word both in conversation and in my academic writing.

Another category that has some traction in modern research is a
semantically based syndrome that goes by the term "specific
comprehension deficit". These are kids that appear to decode ok, but
struggle with understanding the text that they read. However, emerging
evidence suggests that this is not a reading specific comprehension
problem, but has more to do with language and vocabulary issues in
general (https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4134909/).

I would definitely avoid the term "surface  dyslexia". It has its roots
in an aphasia-related acquired syndrome (i.e. due to brain injury, not
genetics), although some have used it in the context of developmental
learning disabilities as well. My advice is to just stay away from the
term altogether.

I hope this helps. On an only tangentially related note, I have started
a website and blog where I intend to indulge in sharing some of my own
idiosyncratic thoughts on research, language, and reading, and maybe
other stuff as well. It's here if you care to take a look:

# Take 3: Dyslexia: an origin story

Take a hard look at how the term was used originally. Also consider
"word blindness". Here's a google ngram search of interest.
