Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are, by Kevin
  Mitchell

In **Innate**, Kevin Mitchell gives a nicely accessible exposition of the relative contributions of genes, shared environment, and the confusingly named non-shared environment to differences in who we are as individuals: in physique, personality, cognition, and so on. The book is a general overview of how genetics and environment work across a wide range of such traits. Mitchell spends little time on any specific syndrome, such as ADHD or dyslexia. But this is a strength of the book and the reader will come away with a better understanding of how genetic endowment, environment, and the luck of the draw are all relevant factors in determining the full range of traits that combine to make each of us unique.

The fact that reading disability runs in families, as do many learning disorders, has been well-established for quite some time now. But a less settled question is that of just what this might mean for diagnosis, classroom practice, and educational policy. Early work in the genetics of reading ability relied primarily on "twin studies", where the development of reading-related skills in identical twins and non-identical twins is tracked over time. These studies affirmed that both genes and environment play a role in accounting for differences in the ease of learning to read.[^1] What has been less well understood until more recently is that the genetic component of individual differences in complex traits like reading ability (or language skills more generally, for that matter), arise through complicated interactions of hundreds, or even thousands, of different genes. Each of these genes, individually, makes a very small contribution, positive or negative, to the trait in question (reading ability, for example), but in aggregate the genetic contribution to differences in a skill like the reading ability can be substantial. There is no one gene that carries most of the weight when it comes to reading ability.

Is it true that: When environment does less, the influence of genes becomes more prominent....
