This is a stub for a series of blog posts where I recommend books and
other readings on topics that people ask me about. Here's a start on
the list:

* Randomistas: How Radical Researchers Are Changing Our World, by
  Andrew Leigh
  
  Evidence-based learning is the buzz word of the last few
  years. Andrew Leigh's *Randomistas* digs in to one of the most
  important forms of evidence, the *randomized controlled trial*, and
  spells out in plain language just what it is, how it works, and why
  it is considered the gold standard for evidence of how things work
  in education and many other areas of research.
   
  The book is written with a popular audience in mind and readers
  won't need any special background to come away with a new
  appreciation for randomized trials and the evidence they provide for
  what is and isn't effective in educational policy and classroom
  practice. That said, the book does not focus on educational research
  in particular. It is about randomized trials in general, and that is
  one of its strengths. 
  
  The book gives specific examples how randomized controlled trials
  show the difference between what works and what doesn't in medicine,
  social policy, education, and many other areas. The results have
  sometimes been surprising, and an important point that Leigh makes
  is that our intuitions (and the intuitions of experts!) about what
  should work are often wrong. Randomized trials let us clearly see
  whether benefits of a program are real, or just wishful thinking.
  
  I recommend this book for parents, teachers, other educators, and
  anyone interested in learning more about the buzz around
  evidence-based education, and the importance of projects like the
  U.S. Department of Education's *What Works Clearinghouse* and the
  independent *Education Endowment Fund*.
   
   



* Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are, by Kevin
  Mitchell
  
* Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes
  Hope, and Wastes Billions, by Richard Harris

* Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us, by Daniel
  Koretz (2008)
  
  A treatise on the design, purpose, and limitations of standardized
  testing in education. Written for students in the Master of
  Education program at Harvard. The book is relatively accessible and
  will provide valuable insight into the purpose and limitations of
  standardized tests for parents, teachers, and other education
  professionals and policy makers. Koretz is a professor of education
  at Harvard University.
