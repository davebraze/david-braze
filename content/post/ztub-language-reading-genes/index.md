What value does genetic testing bring to the table for reading
education, or education in general?

Email from Diane Reott on April 22, 2019, which led me to this
website: https://www.cognitivegenetics.com/ . The crux of the issue is
that the organization behind the site promises genetic testing for RD
that will presumably add-value for those afflicted in the sense of
affording early detection and intervention. The question Diane raised
is whether that is reasonable or a "scam". I note that the web site
does include 2 credible reading researchers on its advisory board, Jan
Frijters and Maureen Lovett. My response to Diane was that she should
be very skeptical.

A few weeks after that exchange, I came across a paper that points up
significant problems with research tying genes to outcomes, here: 
https://dx.doi.org/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18070881
https://sci-hub.tw/10.1176/appi.ajp.2018.18070881

There is an extended comment on the paper here:

This paper addresses the role of a specific set of
[genetic polymorphisms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gene_polymorphism)
to depression. The argument presented there *against* any practical
value in such relationships as genetic biomarkers is compelling, and I
feel carries over to the domain of *Language and Reading and Genes*.

A commentary by Dorothy Bishop, in a more closely connected domain,
but evincing similar skepticism, can be found here:

Here is an article in *Nature* that talks about the limited value of
polygenic scores in general:
