This is a stub for a blog post where I discuss the concept of a data safari (cf. data walk) for people who have little experience with data work.

# What is a Data Safari?

Your organization has data. It might be data that you've collected in-house. It might be data from some public resource that bears on your mission. But, you're not sure how to make best use of it. An *exploration* of the data can be the first step toward using the data you have in hand to answer questions, to track progress, to showcase accomplishments, and so on. It can also highlight limitations of the data you've got, and so be useful in informing future data collection efforts. What data are missing but necessary?

# What Do I Need to Get Started?

## Data

For a data


## Questions

What do you hope to learn? In the near term? In the long run?

You might not have very specific questions at this stage of the game. That's okay. One of the reasons to go on a data safari is to help you to develop your questions, to understand what questions you can or can't answer from the data you already have, and what additional data you might need to really home in on what you want to know.

## Buy-in

Who should be involved in a data safari? Stakeholders of all sorts: Policy makers within your organization; People directly involved in data collection; People (clients or customers) from whom data is collected; others. Sometimes, service organizations will hire former clients as service providers, and these folks can be especially valuable as they bring a dual-perspective to the table.

The data specialist's role is to facilitate conversations about the data among your own people: how and what was collected, and how that might change for the better.
