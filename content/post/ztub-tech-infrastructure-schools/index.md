This is a stub for a blog post where I discuss tech infrastructure in schools and the perils of monopolistic practices by software vendors.

# What is it?

Tech infrastructure in Schools

- student information systems
- human resource management systems
- financial management systems

These kinds of applications, and others that may be in use in schools, are fundamentally rather garden-variety data management and reporting systems. As such, they are often built on a more-or-less standard database/SQL backend. There are many many database toolkits out there built to open standards and designed for interoperability. 

Unfortunately, open standards are anethema to software vendors in general, and Ed Tech vendors are no exception. It is in the *vendors'* interest to box customers into an ever shrinking set of monopolistic choices, locking them in to a proprietery set of products, and constricting the solutions, the flow of data, and the staffing/training options available to them.
