This is a stub for a series of blog posts where I recommend books and
other readings on topics that people ask me about. Here's a start on
the list:


* Innate: How the Wiring of Our Brains Shapes Who We Are, by Kevin
  Mitchell
  
* Rigor Mortis: How Sloppy Science Creates Worthless Cures, Crushes
  Hope, and Wastes Billions, by Richard Harris
  
  This book sheds light on the pressures and perverse incentives that
  academic researchers work under. It may provide useful insight into
  this aspect of educational research consumers of the research like
  parents, teachers, and other stakeholders. 

* Measuring Up: What Educational Testing Really Tells Us, by Daniel
  Koretz (2008)
  
  A treatise on the design, purpose, and limitations of standardized
  testing in education. Written for students in the Master of
  Education program at Harvard. The book is relatively accessible and
  will provide valuable insight into the purpose and limitations of
  standardized tests for parents, teachers, and other education
  professionals and policy makers. Koretz is a professor of education
  at Harvard University.
