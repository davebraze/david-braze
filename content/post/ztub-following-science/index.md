I recently came across an essay in [The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/) entitled *[The Real Scandal About Ivermectin](https://www.theatlantic.com/science/archive/2021/10/ivermectin-research-problems/620473/)*. The article, by James Heathers, is subtitled *Claims about the drug are based on shoddy science—but that science is entirely unremarkable in its shoddiness*. You'll probably be happy to know that I am not here to write about covid or ivermectin, but about a thesis that is miss-ably embedded in the subtitle of that essay: "that science is entirely unremarkable in its shoddiness." I'll come back to that, and tie in to education research and the science of reading in particular, but first let me say that I have tremendous appreciation for what we humans have accomplished through science. 

# Science is Good

Applications of the physical sciences have taken us to the moon and (our mechanical proxies) to the planets. Science has enabled radio communications, computers, electric lights and motors. The biological sciences give us modern agriculture and modern medicine. Cognitive science helps us to understand how our minds learn, reason about, and represent information. It also opens a window on the minds of other living creatures. Recently, it has provided for the development of computer programs that usefully mimic at least some of our own mental capacities. A full understanding of minds, since they are products of biological systems, requires an understanding of the biology that enables them. And, you might say, one mind alone is incomplete. When we people do things, we usually do them together, or at least with the understanding that what we do affects others. When we work or play alone, our choices and behavior are influenced by thought of others. The social sciences aim to understand the scope of human interaction and activity. Among many other things, social science can inform practices for teaching and learning as interactive behaviors that mesh with the cognitive processes that determine learning and knowledge in the individual mind.

# But What *Is* Science?

I've mentioned just a few of the products and topics of science but, before keeping my promise to circle back to the science of reading, I want to get you to think about just what science *is*, whether the focus is physics, biology, cognition, or social behavior. Science is commonly understood as a human activity that accumulates and organizes information in the form of descriptions. Scientific *practice* takes information from multiple sources: expert hunches, anecdotes, formal observations, controlled experiments, the behavior of computer models, and so on. Well-organized information lets us build explanations about what is known (theories) and testable predictions (hypotheses) that take us from the known into the unknown. Beliefs grounded in science are not always black or white. In fact, they are not always *right*. So, it's not unusual for scientific practitioners to hold intermediate degrees of belief in theories and the predictions that they generate. 

Science is an activity, but it's also reasonable to apply that label, *science*, to the descriptions, theories, and hypotheses that are a product of the activity. We might even give the label *science*, to the collective beliefs of scientists in their own theories about how some aspect of the world works. So, we might say that "science is a way of studying and understanding the natural world." Since science is grounded in human thought and behavior, it is subject to all their shortcomings. In truth, there are many ways that science can go wrong. I won't try to enumerate them all. Some of the problems that crop up in the practice of science are worse than others. Others are simply unavoidable. Regardless, I don't want to lose sight of the fact that, whatever its failings, science is still the best method for exploring and understanding the natural world that people have ever devised. 

# Perverse Incentives

Science has made rich contributions to modern society, but because it is a human activity, it is imperfect and subject to human failings. *[Perverse incentives](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5206685/)* in the way that scientists are rewarded for their work have resulted in some problems with the quality of scientific work and the knowledge that stems from it. The idea of a perverse incentive might be summed up in the saying "the road to hell is paved with good intentions." Perversity can arise pretty much anywhere a system of rewards or penalties are used to drive outcomes. If the stakes are high, then folks will be tempted to game the system, and some will succumb to temptation.

An example real world example of a perverse incentive that may be familiar to educators is the case of the [Atlanta Public Schools cheating scandal](https://www.georgiapolicy.org/issue/the-atlanta-public-schools-cheating-scandal/) (APS). In 2001, Congress passed the No Child Left Behind Act which, among other things provided supports for standards-based education reform in order to improve outcomes for disadvantaged students. The legislation required public schools receiving federal funding to administer standardized tests each year in order to track student achievement. Annual improvement on those tests was a condition of the program. A schools repeated failure to hit benchmarks carried stiff penalties, including replacement of staff or even closing the school entirely.

It was determined that from about 2001 to 2011, that Atlanta Public Schools engaged in institutionalized cheating on the state's standardized Criterion-Referenced Competency Test. The intention behind measuring and tracking achievement of students and schools was to motivate higher student performance through a carrot and stick approach. What happened instead is that administrators and teachers cheated. They gave children answers to test questions, or corrected wrong answers. Administrators hid and altered documents. They offered financial incentives to APS employees to encourage the cheating, and punished employees who refused to cheat. 

The incentive to cheat stemmed from the high stakes nature of the test. Federal aid to the district and individual school rankings depended on test performance. Promotions and tenure for APS teachers and administrators hinged in large part on their school's test performance. The rather oppressive *No Child Left Behind* (NCLB), with its strict test-based accountability scheme, had put [many districts around the country in a nearly impossible position](https://www.google.com/books/edition/The_Testing_Charade/ZGUyDwAAQBAJ?hl=en&gbpv=1&dq=the+testing+charade+by+koretz&printsec=frontcover), and this was the result in Atlanta. Intentions behind NCLB (and test-based accountability in general) were good, but the failure lay in the unintended consequences of the incentive structure that emerged from its accountability scheme. 

The incentive structures of science is different, for sure, but the road surface and the destination are similar. Measuring the performance of researchers is at the heart of the incentive structure that we find in science and academic research. The rewards and penalties create the same sort of perversity as seen in the NCLB system of rewards and penalties. 

# Perversity in Science

Science, the activity, can be done well, or it can be done poorly. Even when it is well-executed, outcomes can be ambiguous or uncertain, especially in the short term. This is why scientists will sometimes reserve judgement as to how convincing they find a particular theory, or how likely a particular hypothesis. It's okay to be uncertain

# Sorting the Good from the Bad and the Ugly

Although the article is about research into ivermectin as a treatment for covid, the points made there apply to essentially all areas of science. Three crucial take-aways are:

1. Not all published science/research is worth attending to because published research in any domain is a mix of the good, the bad, and the ugly

2. Sorting out the good from the bad and the ugly is very hard work, even for those with the experience and skills to do it

3. Most people who are not scientists/researchers lack the skill or temperament to do that work. Even some researchers come up short in this department
