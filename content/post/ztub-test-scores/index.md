This is a stub for a blog post on the nature of standardized test scores.

* kinds of assessment
  * formative assessment; relate to norm-referenced
  * summative assessment; relate to criterion-referenced; relate to mastery test
  * norm-referenced (normative samples)
  * criterion-referenced (and use of cut-scores)

* Raw Scores

* kinds of standardized scores
  * standard scores
  * stanines
  * age-equivalent & grade-equivalent scores (and their problems)

Grade equivalent (GE): The grade-equivalent score reflects a student’s performance in terms of the grade level in the norming sample at which the average score is the same as the subject’s score. For example, 2.6 means the student scored the average that someone in the sixth month of the second grade would have scored. This is particularly useful when planning for the instructional needs for the student.

Age equivalent (AE): The age-equivalent score reflects a student’s performance in terms of the age level in the norming sample at which the average score is the same as the subject’s score. For example, 11-4 means the student scored the average that someone 11 years and 4 months old would have scored.

Percentile Rank:  A student's percentile rank indicates the percentage of students in the selected segment of the norming sample who had scores the same as or lower than the subject’s score.  This score shows their relative standing in the population.  PR of 90 means that the student scored as well as or better than 90 percent of the  children in the same grade. 

Standard score:  A standard score helps classify relative standings from very low to very high.  The numbers used are scores and ranges that 2 out of 3 times (or 68% of the time) the student is expected to make on that task.  (131 and above = very superior; 121 - 130 = superior; 111 - 120 = high average; 90 - 110 = average; 80 - 89 = low average; 70 - 79 = low; 69 and below = very low.)

* Normative samples.
  * Is the normative sample a reasonable one in general?
  * Is the normative sample "close enough" to whomever *you* are testing?
  * What happens when the normative sample goes stale?
  
* What are the various types of standardized scores used for? 
  * In assessing individuals: e.g. PPVT
  * In aggregate: state tests
