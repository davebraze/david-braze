In the teaching of reading, the word "phoneme" gets tossed around
frequently. It is an important concept in relation to "phonics" based
approaches to early reading instruction. Reading teachers are
typically taught that a phoneme is a "speech sound",[^1] but that
isn't quite right. In fact a phoneme is best defined as a **set** of
speech sounds. So, a phoneme is an abstraction, a mental category. It
is **not** an individual sound, but rather a collection of speech
sounds that behave similarly; individual speech sounds are called
phones. These phones belong to a specific set, or category, of sounds
(that **set** is the phoneme). So, how does this work?

Let's start by considering the ell sound as it occurs in the words
"like" /la&#x026A;k/ and "milk" /m&#x026A;lk/.[^2] Speakers of English
perceive the ell sounds in these words as being the same, but in fact
they are systematically different. We are conditioned to treat them as
being the same sound because they belong to the same phoneme, but with
a little effort we can tease out their differences. So, let's play
with speech sounds.

First, speak the word "like" several times in a row, putting special
emphasis on its ell sound each time. If you pay attention to the
placement of your tongue tip while producing the ell sound, you will
notice that it is in firm contact with the ridge of gum behind your
top front teeth (it's called the alveolar ridge). You can get that
same ell phone by saying "lalalalala" rapidly. You will notice the
repeated contact of your tongue tip with the alveolar ridge. This the
characteristic tongue movement we use to produce that specific ell
phone. We're going to call this particular ell phone the *light*
ell. This is the ell sound that occurs before vowels.

Now let's look at the word "milk". Again, speak the word several times
in a row with emphasis on its ell sound. If you pay attention to your
tongue position during the ell sound, you will notice that your tongue
tip is not so firmly drawn to the alveolar ridge, if it touches it at
all. In fact, the main tongue movement for the ell in milk is for the
**back** of the tongue to raise up until it comes in contact with the
soft palate (the rear part of the roof of your mouth). We will call
this alternative ell sound the *dark* ell. You can pull off the same
trick as with "lalala" for the *light* ell, by repeating the word "call"
several times in a row with no breaks in between. The *dark* ell is
the ell sound that typically occurs after vowels. (It's not quite that
simple, but close enough for present purposes.)

The *light* ell of "like" and the *dark* ell of "milk" are noticeably
different speech sounds and they are produced with different tongue
gestures. You can, if you choose, easily pronounce the word "milk", or
"call", while keeping the tip of your tongue tucked firmly behind your
bottom front teeth. But if you try the same thing with the word
"like", its ell sound will be noticeably defective. (Go ahead. Give it
a try.) The light ell and the dark ell are different phones (different
speech sounds) but English speakers treat them as belonging to the
same category of speech sounds, the same phoneme.

So what about the short-hand of calling a phoneme a speech sound? It
is mostly a matter of glossing over what some might consider a
niggling detail of little relevance. Certainly, in speech, a phoneme
has to make its presence known somehow, so, it will be represented by
a contextually appropriate *phone*.

But I think this detail matters
in a couple of important ways. First, the alphabetic principle at the
core of the English writing system is a mapping between phonemes and
letters. That's why our spelling system maps light ell and dark ell to
the same letter. Second,

      sounds (**phonemes**), speakers of an oral language say and
      understand many thousands of words" (p3).
