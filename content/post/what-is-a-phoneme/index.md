The word "phoneme" gets tossed around a lot in talk of early reading
instruction. It is an important concept in relation to phonics based
approaches to the subject. Reading teachers are typically taught that
a phoneme is a "speech sound",[^1] but that isn't quite right. In
fact, a phoneme is better defined as a **set** of speech sounds. So, a
phoneme is a mental abstraction, a category. It is **not** an
individual sound, but rather a collection of speech sounds that behave
similarly. Individual speech sounds are called phones. These phones
belong to a specific set, or category, of sounds,[^2] and it is the
collection of sounds that makes up the phoneme. How does this work,
then?

Let's start by considering the ell sound as it occurs in the words
"like" /la&#x026A;k/ and "milk" /m&#x026A;lk/.[^3] Speakers of English
perceive the ell sounds in these words as being the same, but in fact
they are systematically different. We are conditioned to treat them as
being the same sound because they belong to the same phoneme, but with
a little effort we can tease out their differences. So, let's play
with speech sounds.

First, say the word "like" out loud several times in a row. If you pay
attention to the placement of your tongue tip while producing the ell
sound, you will notice that it is in firm contact with the ridge of
gum behind your top front teeth (it's called the alveolar ridge). You
can get that same ell phone by saying "lalalalala" rapidly. You will
notice the repeated contact of your tongue tip with the alveolar
ridge. This is the characteristic tongue movement we use to produce
that specific ell phone; a specific instance of a phoneme is called a
*phone*. We're going to call this particular ell phone the *light*
ell. This is the ell sound that occurs before vowels.

Now, let's look at the word "milk". Again, speak the word several
times in a row with row. If you pay attention to your tongue position
during the ell sound, you will notice that your tongue tip is not so
firmly drawn to the alveolar ridge, if it touches it at all. In fact,
the main tongue movement for the ell in milk is for the **back** of
the tongue to raise up until it comes in contact with the soft palate
(the rear part of the roof of your mouth). We will call this
alternative ell sound (phone) the *dark* ell. You can pull off the
same trick as with "lalala" for the *light* ell, by repeating the word
"call" several times in a row with no breaks in between. The *dark*
ell is the ell phone that typically occurs after vowels. (It's not
quite that simple, but close enough for present purposes.)

The *light* ell of "like" and the *dark* ell of "milk" are noticeably
different speech sounds and they are produced with different, although
similar, tongue movements. You can, if you choose, easily pronounce
the word "milk", or "call", while keeping the tip of your tongue
tucked firmly behind your bottom front teeth, to keep your tongue tip
from touching the alveolar ridge. But if you try the same thing with
the word "like", its ell sound will be noticeably defective. (Go
ahead. Give it a try.) The light ell and the dark ell are different
phones (different speech sounds), but English speakers treat them as
belonging to the same category of speech sound, the same
phoneme. They are both ells.

In fact, when the need arises, linguists will use a more detailed
transcription to represent the phones that occur in a word, instead of
the phonemes. This is called phonetic transcription and these are
placed between square brackets, instead of slashes, to set them apart
from phonemic transcriptions. Each phonetic variant of a phoneme will
be represented by a different symbol. So, while the phonemic
transcription of "milk" is as given above ("/m&#x026A;lk/"), the
phonetic transcription looks like this: [m&#x026A;&#x26B;k]. Notice
that in the first case, we use the same symbol (/l/) as in "like".
That's because we have the same phoneme in both words. But in the
second case, we use a different symbol ([&#x26B;]). In this case we
are representing the specific phone, which is different than the ell phone
that occurs in "like".

So what about the short-hand of calling a phoneme a speech sound? Does
it matter if we gloss over what some might consider a niggling detail
of little relevance? Certainly, in speech, a phoneme has to make its
presence known somehow. So, it will be represented by a contextually
appropriate *phone*. In hearing speech, it's usually easy to relate
each phone that you hear to the right phoneme. Exceptions can arise
for a number of reasons, some more interesting than others. A few of
the more common include: noise in the environment, inattention on the
part of the listener, speaker's accent unfamiliar to listener, and so
on.

That said, there are at least a couple of reasons that phone--phoneme
mappings may be of particular relevance in the classroom. First, the
alphabetic principle at the core of the English writing system is a
mapping between phonemes and letters. That's why our spelling system
maps light ell and dark ell to the same letter. Beginning readers may
go through a phase where they try to map letters to phones instead of
phonemes, and that can make for some creative spellings. A reading
teacher needs to be able to recognize that that's what is happening
and help the student through it. Another issue is that, in different
dialects of English, each phoneme may consist of different sets of
phones. For example, speakers of some varieties of English may,
instead of the dark ell, use a vowel sound (phone) as the variant of
the ell phoneme that occurs after vowels. An example would be a
pronunciation of "milk" as [m&#x026A;&#x28A;k]. The teacher should be
able to recognize that this vowel phone is still a part of the ell
phoneme, and instruct accordingly.

In this post, I've tried to shed light on the nature of phonemes and
their relationship to speech sounds (phones), and to touch on why it
can matter in teaching reading. Certainly, much more can be said,
about phonemes and about the connection of speech to reading. I'll
follow up on both these things in later blog posts.

      sounds (**phonemes**), speakers of an oral language say and
      understand many thousands of words" (p3).

[^2]: Actually, there are a couple of complications here that we'll
      put aside for another day. The first is that the mental
      representation of a *phoneme* includes information not only about
      its perceptual properties (sounds), but also about the speech
      gestures (vocal tract movements) required to produce it. Second,
      an individual *phone* (sound/gesture) can belong to more than one
      phoneme!

[^3]: I'll follow the linguistic convention of putting phonemic
      transcriptions between forward slashes.
