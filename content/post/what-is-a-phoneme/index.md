In the teaching of reading, the word "phoneme" gets tossed around
frequently. It is an important concept in relation to "phonics" based
approaches to teaching reading. In that context, reading teachers are
typically taught that a phoneme is a "speech sound", but that isn't
quite right. In fact a phoneme is best defined as a ***set*** of
speech sounds. So a phoneme is an abstraction, a mental category. It
is not a sound that you can actually hear, although you can hear then
individual speech sounds (called phones) that belong to a specific set
or category of sounds (the phoneme). How does that work?

Let's start by considering the ell sound as it occurs in the words
"like" /la&#x026A;k/ and "milk" /m&#x026A;lk/. Speakers of English
perceive those sounds as being the same, but in fact they are
systematically different. We perceive them as being the same sound
because they belong to the same phoneme. But with a little effort we
can tease out their differences.

So, let's play with speech sounds. First, speak the word "like"
several times in a row, putting special emphasis on its ell sound each
time. If you pay attention to the placement of your tongue tip while
producing the ell sound, you will notice that it is in firm contact
with the ridge of gum behind your top front teeth (it's called the
alveolar ridge). Now move to "milk". Again, speak the word several
times in a row with emphasis on it's ell sound. If you attend to your
tongue position while doing so, you will notice that your tongue tip
is not so firmly drawn to the alveolar ridge. In fact, the main tongue
movement for the ell in milk is for the back of the tongue to raise up
until it comes in contact with the soft palate (the rear part of the
roof of your mouth). You can, if you choose, easily pronounce the word
"milk" while keeping the tip of your tongue firmly tucked behind your
bottom front teeth. If you try the same thing with the word "like",
its ell sound will be noticeably defective.

This playing with speech sounds is intended to convince you that the
ell sounds in these two words are actually different speech sounds,
produced by different movements of the tongue.
