I am happy to talk with educators, parent groups, or non-profit organizations, about the foundations of reading, writing, and language. If you would like to learn more, please contact me.

If you are a non-profit organization trying to figure out how to make better use of data, no matter what your mission, I may be able to nudge you toward some helpful resources. Let's talk!
