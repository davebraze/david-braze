I am happy to talk with educators, parent groups, or anyone else,
about my research into the foundations of reading, writing, and
language. If you would like to learn more, please contact me.

I am available to make a presentation to your group, to host a visit
to Haskins Labs, or just to chat about research into literacy and
language, or the connections between research and classroom practices
and educational policy.
