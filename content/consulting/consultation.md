[The first step is to set up a free-of-charge discovery call.](/contact) This is a chance for me to learn more about you and your needs, and for you to learn about me. It usually takes about 30 minutes.

If we decide to move ahead, a second call may be needed to review your data and to pin down additional details. We would then work together to generate a contract that spells out in detail the work to be done, deliverables, time frame, and price. Generally, I charge on a *per-project* basis. Once a contract is inked, we hold a kickoff meeting and then the magic begins.

Even if you don't have immediate needs, please feel free to connect. I'm always happy to talk shop, whether or not we end up working together. I also write [blog posts](/posts) on data related matters 2-3 times a year and will happily send a notice when new ones go out.
