I provide consultation to non-profit organizations, government, and
industry. I specialize in helping organizations to find patterns in
data that will help them to develop solutions to their unique
challenges.

Your data may be generated internally, or it may come from public
sources like state departments of education, the US census, and so on,
or both. Regardless, I can help you to use the information available
to you to uncover actionable insights to better serve your clients and
communities.

Generally, I work on a on a fee-for-service basis, although I take on
occasional *pro bono* work for non-profits, as
well. [Get in touch](/contact) if you would like to learn more. I will
provide references on request.
