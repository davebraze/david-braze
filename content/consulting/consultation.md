You have data and a story to tell or questions to answer. I know data and can help you to get the most from yours. I specialize in helping organizations find patterns in data that will let them address their unique challenges.

Your data may be generated internally, or it may come from public sources like the US census, or a state department of education, or a proprietary resource.  Regardless, I can help you to use data to generate insights you can use to communicate your goals and successes to funders and other stakeholders.

Generally, I work on a on a fee-for-service basis, although I take on occasional *pro bono* work for non-profits as well. [Get in touch](/contact) if you would like to learn more. I'm always happy to talk shop, whether or not we end up working together.
