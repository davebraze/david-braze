***All people use language***, or will learn to use it, with a few
exceptions. Any typical infant, who has reasonable exposure to the
language of others, is sure to acquire the language(s) of its
community. In fact, even in the face of many physical or intellectual
challenges, language emerges.

A central goal of the language and cognitive sciences is to explain the
capacities and processes that provide for ***language acquisition***,
including features of production and comprehension in each developmental
state.

Any real explanation of language abilities must cover ***individual
variation***, including both "normal" variation and disordered
language. So, the mental aspects of language use and language
acquisition are primary. But, a complete explanation must also address
how language is used for actual communication.

People in literate societies, like ours, often think of the ability to
write and to read as a part of language, inseparable from it, but they
aren't. Actually, ***writing and reading are "language-adjacent"
skills***. They come after language, and they depend on language, but
they don't come nearly as easily or naturally as speaking and
understanding speech.

Understanding the how and why of this basic truth about writing and
reading is one of the most ***important goals of my research***.

**More to come....**
