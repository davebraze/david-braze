***All people use language***, or will learn to use it, with few
exceptions. Any typical infant, who has reasonable exposure to the
language of others, is sure to acquire the language(s) of its
community. In fact, even in the face of most physical or intellectual
challenges, language emerges.

It is undeniably true that ***people differ in their language
abilities***. Any real explanation of how language works must account
for this individual variation, including both "normal" variation and
disordered language. More, a complete explanation must also address
how language is used for actual communication, and how well it
supports other abilities that depend on it.

People in literate societies, like ours, often think of the ability to
write and to read as a part of language. Many would consider these to
be the most important parts of language, but they aren't. Actually,
***writing and reading are "language-adjacent" skills***. They come
after language, and they depend on language, but they don't come
nearly as naturally or as easily as speaking and understanding
speech. Language gets along just fine without writing or reading, but
the opposite is not true.

Understanding the how and why of this basic truth about writing and
reading, and its implications for education, is ***an important goal
of my research***.

I have more thoughts on language, reading, educational practice and
policy, research, and other topics. Find them in my [Blog](/post).
