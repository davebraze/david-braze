***All people use language***, or will learn to use it, with a few
exceptions. If a baby is neurologically "typical", and has reasonable
exposure to the language of others, it is sure to acquire the language(s)
of its community.

A central goal of the language and cognitive sciences is to explain the
capacities and processes that provide for ***language acquisition***,
including features of production and comprehension in each developmental
state.

Any real explanation of language abilities must cover ***individual
variation***, including both "normal" variation and disordered
language. So, the mental aspects of language use and language acquisition
are primary. But, a complete explanation should also address how language
is used for actual communication.

People in literate societies, like ours, often think of the ability to
write and to read as a part of language, inseparable from it, but it
isn't. Actually, ***writing and reading are "language-adjacent"
skills***. They come after language, and they depend on language, but they
don't come nearly as easily as speaking, or understanding speech.

Understanding the how and why of this basic truth about writing and reading
is one of the most ***important goals of my research***.

**More to come....**
