Psycholinguistics is concerned with characterizing the human capacity for language in both it's psychological and social contexts.

A central goal of the language and cognitive sciences is to provide a theoretical account of the structures, capacities and processes that underlie language acquisition, including features of production and comprehension in each developmental state.

This implies that a focus on language in its psychological aspect is primary.

However, a complete theory must address language use in real communicative contexts.

Moreover, we should be careful to consider language specific capacities within a broad cognitive framework.

A complete theory must explain individual variation in linguistic ability, including both 'normal' variation and disordered language.
