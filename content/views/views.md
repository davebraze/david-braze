***All people use language***, or will learn to use it, with few
exceptions. Any typical infant, who has reasonable exposure to the
language of others, is sure to acquire the language(s) of its
community. In fact, even in the face of many physical or intellectual
challenges, language emerges.

Any real explanation of language abilities must cover individual
variation, how ***people differ in their abilities***, including both
"normal" variation and disordered language. More, a complete
explanation must also address how language is used for actual
communication, and how well it supports other abilities that depend on
it.

People in literate societies, like ours, often think of the ability
to write and to read as a part of language. These are often considered
the most important parts of language, but they aren't. Actually,
***writing and reading are "language-adjacent" skills***. They come
after language, and they depend on language, but they don't come
nearly as naturally or as easily as speaking and understanding
speech. Language gets along just fine without writing or reading, but
the opposite is not true.

Understanding the how and why of this basic truth about writing and
reading, and its implications for education, is ***an important goal
of my research***.

**More to come....**
