Data can be cold and impersonal. It is almost inevitably biased. Bias comes about in many ways. A data set may embody the biases of the people who collect it, or those of the people it is collected from. A data set may be biased because of who is *not included*. 

These days, we are almost drowning in data, but it takes skill and a clear eye to make *good* use of imperfect data, and all data is imperfect. A solid first step is to keep in mind that our "data points" represent people. It's important not to lose sight of that. As users of a data set, we have have obligations of care and consideration to the people that the data is about, and even to those who were not included but maybe should have been.

The goals of data users may be to tell stories or answer questions or guide decisions. But all use should keep clearly in mind the people whose lives are mirrored in a data set. How will they be affected by your stories, your answers, your decisions? How will those not included be affected? Care and compassion go a long ways toward 


I have more thoughts on practical data use in policy, research, and other areas. Find them in my [Blog](/post).
