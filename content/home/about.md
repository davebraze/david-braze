I have more than 20 years experience collecting, summarizing, and analyzing data for non-profit, government and industry.

My experience ranges over data analysis & visualization, program evaluation & development, project management, report & grant writing, research design, data monitoring & validation, and  presenting findings to specialist and general audiences.

You have data and a story to tell, or questions looking for answers. I know data and can help you to get the most from yours. I specialize in helping organizations find patterns in data that will let them address their unique challenges.

Your data may be generated internally, or it may come from public sources like the US census, or a state department of education, or some proprietary resource.  Let me support you in using your data to communicate your goals and successes to internal or external stakeholders.

I can help you to spend less time worrying about data and more time on your core mission by working with you to

- make the best use of the data you have now
- collect the best possible data going forward
- tell compelling stories with data and data visualizations
- craft data-driven reports for clients or stakeholders
- build capacity for data work that will simplify your life
