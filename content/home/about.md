I am a researcher and consultant with more than 20 years of experience
in the areas of language, literacy, and cognition, and their
application to education.

I bring extensive experience to the table, ranging over program
evaluation & development, project management, grant writing, research
design, data monitoring and validation, data analysis, and
presentation of research findings to specialist and general audiences.

I provide consultation to non-profits, government, and industry in
these areas. [Find out more.](/consulting)
