I have more than 20 years experience collecting, and analyzing data for industry, government, and non-profits, and I am looking for a new opportunity and a new challenge for the next phase of my life in data.

My experience ranges over data analysis & visualization, ad hoc and canned reports, research design, data monitoring & validation, and communicating data findings to specialist and general audiences.

You have data and questions looking for answers, or a story to tell. I know data and can help you to get the most from yours. I specialize in finding patterns in data that help organizations address their unique challenges.

You'll find my LinkedIn profile here: https://www.linkedin.com/in/davebraze/ . Let's talk.
