I am looking for a new opportunity to build the next phase of my life in data. 

With 20 years experience collecting and analyzing data for industry, government, and non-profits, I have deep expertise in data monitoring & validation, data cleaning, statistical analysis & data visualization, ad hoc and canned reports, and communicating data findings to specialist and general audiences. Along the way, I've learned a lot about teamwork, team building, and project management.

You have data and a story to tell, or questions that need answers. I know data and can help you to get the most from yours. 

You'll find more details in [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/davebraze/). Let's talk.
