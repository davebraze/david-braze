I do research in the areas of language, literacy, and cognition, and their
application to education. I have wide experience with behavioral
and neurocognitive methods, including standardized cognitive and language
assessments, neuroimaging, and eye-tracking. I am always looking for
interesting collaborations. Drop me a note if you want to talk about
working together.

My responsibilities at Haskins Labs range over: program development, project
management, grant writing, research design, data monitoring and validation,
data analysis, and presentation of research findings to professional and
lay audiences.

I also provide consultation to non-profits, government, and industry on matters
related to my research interests. [Reach out](/contact) if you would like to learn more.
